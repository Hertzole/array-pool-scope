# Array Pool Scope

Array Pool Scope allows you to use ArrayPool in a scope-like manner.

## üí® Quick Start

```csharp
using Hertzole.Buffers;

int length = 10;
// Use a using statement to automatically return the array to the pool.
using (ArrayPoolScope<int> pool = new ArrayPoolScope<int>(length))
{
    // For loop
    for (int i = 0; i < pool.Count; i++)
    {
        pool.Array[i] = i;
        Console.WriteLine(pool.Array[i]);
    }

    // Foreach loop
    foreach (int item in pool)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(item);
    }
}

// Manully return the array to the pool.
ArrayPoolScope<int> pool = new ArrayPoolScope<int>(length);
pool.Dispose();

// Provide your own pool.
ArrayPool<int> customPool = ArrayPool<int>.Create();
using ArrayPoolScope<int> pool = new ArrayPoolScope<int>(length, customPool);

// Get directly from pool
using ArrayPoolScope<int> pool = ArrayPool<int>.Shared.RentScope(length);

// As span and memory
using ArrayPoolScope<int> pool = ArrayPool<int>.Shared.RentScope(length);
Span<int> span = pool.AsSpan();
Memory<int> memory = pool.AsMemory();
```

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

For Unity development, you need the following:
- [Unity 2021.3.0f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.0)

### Building

To build the project, you can use the `dotnet` CLI.

```bash
dotnet build
```

### Testing

To run the tests, you can use the `dotnet` CLI.

```bash
dotnet test
```

### Unity

The main SDK should be the "single source of truth". This means that all code should be written in the main project and then copied over to the Unity project. 

To open the project in Unity, you need to open the `Unity` folder as a project.
